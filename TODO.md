Nice to Have Features
=====================

(Which might be added in the future, if time permits) <br/>
(Some of them will be external plugins)

Technical improvements:

 * Move to latest Bootstrap version (data-xxx becomes data-bs-xxx)
 * Test if the recent changes for planned version 2.0.0 break existing slides
 * Port from mini-tutorial.js: Split HTML documents, plugin array instead of object
 * Release new version 2.0.0
 * Update presentation templates, move from webpack to esbuild
 * Remove jQuery dependency

In no particular order:

 * Improvements to the responsive design on tablets and smartphones
 * Minor adjustments to the font sizes (headings smaller in side text, smaller header bar)
 * Possibility to reverse sizes (side text large, slide content small)
 * Alternative slide style: TOC left, Slide + Text right
 * Remove indention of TOC entries (possibly styling chapter heading with smaller font size, small-caps and darkgrey color)

 Costly and therefor unlikely to implement:

 * Download of a slide deck to a single, self-contained file
 * Search within all slides
 * Offline comments and annotations to slides
 * Shared comments and annotations visible to all users (stored on server)
 * Meta deck: Includes all slide deck HTML files to one large deck ready for print or download
 * Phonegap based smartphone app for offline reading
